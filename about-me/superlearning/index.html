    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p> It all started in May of 2018 when a good friend and co-worker asked me if I wanted to do something new career/technology wise. Luis Suarez is his name. He told me I should look into AWS certifications. Shortly after deep diving into a few online courses, I became obsessed and saw an opportunity to take my career to the next level with something I was excited about.</p>
    <p> I always told myself and others that I was not a good test taker so I was determinded to prove myself wrong. For the next few months, I would do the typical bing studying for the exams taking every angle possible. </p>
    <p> This would eventually lead me to obtaining 3 AWS associate level certifications in less than 5 months. I followed this with an update of my resume and took my first step into a new career path. As I gained experience in my role, I was encourged to take the fast track by obtaining a professional level certification which required mininum experience of 2 years on top of an incredible amount of technical information I had to memorize.</p>
    <p> I went on to attempt the exam for professional certification over the next 7 months and failing 5 times. I didn't fully understand my problem or at least did not see it as a main contributor to holding me back. I quickly became a top quality engineer that others came to for help and was respected.</p>
    <p> The common denominator was always running out of time and the ability to read and comprehend the question in a timely manner.</p>
