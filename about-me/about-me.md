# Introduction
I am a problem solver, husband and father to 2 wonderful boys, and avid learner of all things!

I love learning how to learn, technology, and building meaningful things.

Keeping my body and brain healthy/optimized to the best of my ability to experience/learn new things is always top priority.

I highly value the time I have to be with family and friends, learn and experience, pursue ambitious projects, and push the limits of my mind and body.

I'm super excited of what the future holds and sharing what I have learned with others. Conversely, hearing the experiences of others has been key to my version of success.

## What is in store for me 2020?

1. I have set out to read 52 books this year.

2. I will increase my reading speed to over 600 wpm and 90% plus comprehension.

3. I will be learning two piano songs and performing them in front of an audience.

4. I will make at least one functional project public to help as many people as possible.

5. I will get better at asking for help.
