    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I am a problem solver, husband and father to 2 wonderful boys, and avid learner of all things!</p>
    <p>I love learning how to learn, technology, and building meaningful things.</p>
    <p>Keeping my body and brain healthy/optimized to the best of my ability to experience/learn new things is always top priority.</p>
    <p>I highly value the time I have to be with family and friends, learn and experience, pursue ambitious projects, and push the limits of my mind and body.</p>
    <p>I'm super excited of what the future holds and sharing what I have learned with others. Conversely, hearing the experiences of others has been key to my version of success.</p>
