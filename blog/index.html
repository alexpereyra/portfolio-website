My <a href=https://aosreminders.com/subscribe>subscription page</a> in <a href=https://aosreminders.com>AoS Reminders</a> has a couple of demo gifs to show people what they’re buying, and I decided I wanted to speed the page up by only using mp4 files.</p><p>So I dutifully converted my gifs to mp4s and set up an auto-playing video in place of the <code class=highlighter-rouge>img</code> elements. All was well, and I shipped the code without a second thought.</p><p>And then, a few hours later, I decided to check if the deployment had worked. I opened up my phone and… the videos were blank.</p><p>Turns out iOS doesn’t quite support webm/mp4 files yet, and you need to provide a fallback image in that case. So I wrote a quick component to help me do that - it displays an auto-playing video by default on compatible devices, and falls back to a gif (or any other image you desire) using the <code class=highlighter-rouge>poster</code> attribute of <code class=highlighter-rouge>video</code> elements. The CSS is straight from <a href=https://getbootstrap.com>Bootstrap</a>.

I walked past a lot of tables where people were groaning “Oh right, you get to go first for some reason.”</p><p>In my own Narrative games, I noticed that people really hated playing against Slaanesh. I was lucky enough to be on the same side of the table, so I didn’t have to deal with it, but I could see the frustration and helplessness that our opoonents felt. No matter how they approached a battle, they were essentially useless in combat until Slaanesh had done their thing.</p><div class="row pt-1 pb-3"><div class=col-6><figure><a href=/blog/public/img/warhammer/nova-open-2019/IMG_2307.jpg target=_blank><img src=/blog/public/img/thumbnails/warhammer/nova-open-2019/IMG_2307.jpg class=img-thumbnail></a><figcaption class="text-center pt-1"><small>Game 1: My Ripperdactyls deleting a unit from the field.

But I can definitely say that it sucks to play against armies that modify combat activation.</p><p>I saw like… one Seraphon army in the GT. I don’t think they are in the best place.</p><p>I saw a lot of Shootcast, a lot of Skaven, and of course, FEC, DoK, and Slaanesh. I saw some beautifully painted Kharadron Overlords, but I’m not sure how they fared in battle.</p><p>As far as my army list went, I went with a spell-heavy build centered around Kroak and the new Meteoric Convocation. It’s fun to drop global mortal wounds on the map :) Combined with a 6-model Ripperdactyl detachment with a Shadowstrike battalion, I was able to cripple my opponent early with a devastating alpha strike, and then follow it up by clustering around Kroak and sending Skinks to take objectives.</p><h3 id=the-venue>The Venue</h3><p>There were five or six floors <em>absolutely packed</em> with wargaming action. I walked around and just soaked up the ambient sportsmanship, good will, and good humor that permeated the air. There is something very special about being around people who have a strong passion - and this was a passionate group of people.</p><p>The orchestras playing pop music, the random “WAAAAAAGH”s coming from the vendor stalls, the food trucks, and the general feeling of closeness with other tabletop players - incredible. I think the Hyatt did a great job of hosting this event!</p><h3 id=aos-reminders---what-a-hit>AoS Reminders - What a hit!</h3><p>I walked around the tournament halls wearing my <a href=https://aosreminders.com>AoS Reminders</a> shirt.</p><p>I was amazed at the response that the tool has generated. Every row of tables had at least a few people using the printout. When AoS players noticed my shirt, they would gush about how much it helps them, their significant other, their kids, or their local tournaments.</p><p>The competitive players talked a lot about using the tool to find hidden synergies in their lists - theorycrafting by adding/removing units and seeing where they could stack abilities in certain phases.</p><p>The casual players (like me!) were just happy that they weren’t forgetting their abilities anymore.</p><p>I asked just about everyone I talked to one question:</p><blockquote class=lead><h5><em>"What would you change about AoS Reminders?"</em></h5></blockquote><p>The responses I got were astounding. Some people had noticed typos. Others had various UI tweaks - great ideas that I’ll implement within the month.</p><p>I would estimate that 70% of the people I talked to mentioned one thing - they want to be able to save and load their army rosters. I’m happy to announce that… you’ll be able to learn more about <em>that</em> feature in about a week, when the next Rolling Bad podcast comes out. I did an interview talking about AoS Reminders and my future plans for the tool.</p><p><strong>Speaking of which…</strong></p><p>The past few weeks have been a whirlwind regarding <a href=https://aosreminders.com>AoS Reminders</a>.</p><p>I made the decision to move the tool from this website (<strong>alexander.pereyra.info</strong>) to its new home - <strong><a href=https://aosreminders.com>aosreminders.com</a></strong>. As much as I enjoyed getting ~40,000 visitors to my site in just a couple months, I realized that it’s better for the long-term success of the project to move it to an actual URL.</p><p>Our number of contributors grew even higher - 15 people have now contributed code to the tool!</p><p>We’ve added more armies, more rules, and a better mobile experience.</p><p>There’s more to come, too. I’ve got some pretty big plans in the works!</p><h3 id=media-mentions>Media Mentions</h3><ul><li><a href=http://rollingbad.libsyn.com/supernova>Rolling Bad Ep. 74</a><ul><li>Starts at 1:17:30 (15+ minute interview with me)</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/484930823?t=01h31m00s">The Honest Wargamer</a><ul><li>Starts at 1:31:00</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://youtu.be/gVN35K4ryuE?t=3481">Mr. Mephisto’s AOS Rantcast Ep.9</a><ul><li>Starts at 58:00</li></ul></li><li><a href=https://rollingbad.libsyn.com/we-go-chaotic-with-warcry-and-too-much-sugar>Rolling Bad Ep. 73</a><ul><li>Starts at 37:30</li></ul></li><li><a href=https://www.realmandruin.com/37>Realm and Ruin Ep. 37</a><ul><li>Starts at 3:15</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://wwwargaming.podbean.com/e/wide-world-of-wargaming-age-of-sigmar-episode-33/">Wide World of Wargaming Age of Sigmar Ep. 33</a><ul><li>Starts at 18:10</li></ul></li><li><a href="http://cubicshenanigans.net/the-state-of-death-with-dr-death-warcry-walkthrough-40k-updates-episode-35/">Cubic Shenanigans Ep. 35</a><ul><li>Starts at 6:35</li></ul></li><li><a href=https://spikeybits.com/2019/08/this-game-aide-will-change-your-warhammer-games-forever.html>Spikey Bits - This Game Aide Will Change Your Warhammer Games Forever!</a></li></ul><div class="row text-center pb-3"><div class=col-12><div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe class=embed-responsive-item src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2xuizUIqN3g?start=243" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><div class=col-12><small>Shoutout from Doom and Darkness, an amazing Australian Warhammer personality!<br>He talks about AoS Reminders starting around 4:10.</small></div></div><h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h3><div class="row text-center pt-1 pb-2"><div class=col><img class=img-fluid src=https://zippy.gfycat.com/ActualWelltodoGermanshorthairedpointer.gif></div></div></div><hr><div><h1><a href=/blog/2019/08/19/update-on-age-of-sigmar-reminders.html>Update on Age of Sigmar Reminders - Three Months Later</a></h1><h5 class="small pb-2">19 Aug 2019</h5><div class="row justify-content-center pt-1 pb-3"><div class="col-6 text-center"><a href=/blog/public/img/warhammer/aos-reminders/g-mobile1.png target=_blank><img src=/blog/public/img/thumbnails/warhammer/aos-reminders/g-mobile1.png class=img-thumbnail></a></div><div class="col-6 text-center"><a href=/blog/public/img/warhammer/aos-reminders/g-mobile2.png target=_blank><img src=/blog/public/img/thumbnails/warhammer/aos-reminders/g-mobile2.png class=img-thumbnail></a></div><div class="col text-center"><small><a href="https://aosreminders.com/" target=_blank>AoS Reminders</a> - Mobile UI</small></div></div><p>Three months ago, <a href=https://alexander.pereyra.info/blog/2019/05/17/aos-reminders-seraphon.html>I posted on my website</a> about a tool I had built for my Warhammer army.

I received an overwhelming amount of positive feedback from Lustria Online, TGA, and Reddit.</p><div class="row pt-1 pb-3"><div class="col text-center"><figure><a href=/blog/public/img/warhammer/aos-reminders/ui-seraphon.png target=_blank><img src=/blog/public/img/thumbnails/warhammer/aos-reminders/ui-seraphon.png class=img-thumbnail></a><figcaption class="text-center pt-1"><small>It looked like this at the time: Note the multiple dropdowns.

People also wanted to be able to add spells, endless spells, realmscapes, soup armies, command traits, triumphs, and more.</p><h3 id=what-is-aos-reminders>What is AoS Reminders?</h3><p>For those who aren’t familiar, <a href=https://www.games-workshop.com/en-US/Warhammer>Warhammer: Age of Sigmar</a> is the successor to <a href=https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Warhammer_Fantasy_Battle>Warhammer Fantasy</a>. Battles are fought over the course of five turns. Each turn consists of your round, and your opponent’s round. A single round has the following phases:</p><ol><li>Hero Phase (spells, buffs, heals, etc)</li><li>Movement Phase</li><li>Shooting Phase</li><li>Charging Phase</li><li>Combat Phase</li><li>Battleshock Phase (see if anyone runs away after losing casualties)</li></ol><p>Each of those phases is further divided into three sections:</p><ol><li>Start of Phase</li><li>During Phase</li><li>End of Phase</li></ol><p>Let’s say we have a powerful artifact equipped by our general. A typical artifact may have rules that specifically activate at the “start of the combat phase” and “during the battleshock phase”.</p><p>A Wizard may have a spell that is <em>cast</em> during the Hero phase, but affects units during the Movement and Shooting phase.</p><p>One of the things about Warhammer is that you can’t “go back” during a phase. If you start using your rules that are triggered <em>during</em> combat, you can’t go “oh, wait, I need to use this <em>start of combat</em> rule first!” This makes remembering your rules of paramount importance.</p><p>As you might imagine, the amount of rules for a large army can be staggering - and a lot of Warhammer battles boil down to endlessly consulting your rulebook to make sure you’re not missing a rule. However, there’s not a single Warhammer player on the planet that hasn’t exclaimed “Awww shit, I forgot to activate a rule last phase!”</p><p>A lot of players build custom spreadsheets and handwritten notes reminding them when to use certain abilities. I decided to overengineer my solution a little bit by building AoS Reminders.</p><h3 id=starting-to-grow-the-codebase>Starting to grow the codebase</h3><p>I started to realize that building this thing was a daunting task after I added my first few armies to the application. I was pretty pleased at this point - I had a decently architected codebase, and data entry was fairly painless. For the most part, adding an army <em>just worked</em>.</p><p>However, as I moved through the first four armies, I started to notice there were units, abilities, and rules that didn’t exactly match my early mental model of how an AoS army worked. This meant that I had to add more logic and options to the code.</p><p>At this point, I wasn’t using any sort of store management - the app is written in React - all of the application state was simply stored in my <code class=highlighter-rouge>App.tsx</code> file and passed down to child elements when necessary. I started to have tons of handlers for updating state littered across the codebase. Which obviously begs the question…</p><h4 id=why-no-redux-at-this-point>Why no Redux at this point?</h4><p>It just didn’t feel necessary when I was first building out the page. Remember, this started out as a toy application that handled one use case - letting me dynamically build a list of reminders for my Seraphon army.</p><h4 id=well-we-need-redux-now>Well, we need Redux now!</h4><p>With the amount of information that I was tucking into my state, the whole app was re-rendering constantly whenever a single change was made. I started out by building my Redux store the old fashioned way - which I hate doing. And then - I found <strong>Redux Starter Kit</strong> - and my whole life changed.</p><p><strong>Redux Starter Kit</strong> comes with a ton of features out of the box. It automatically manages different slices of your state, provides actionHandlers, selectors, and reducers, and uses <strong>Immer</strong> to produce immutable state updates. It was super easy to install and use, and it only took me one night to convert the application from local state management to a Redux store.</p><h3 id=contributors-to-the-rescue>Contributors to the rescue</h3><p>Whenever I posted my latest progress on Reddit or other forums, I got essentially two pieces of feedback:</p><ol><li><em>“Looks great, this is awesome!”</em></li><li><em>“Can you add my army?”</em></li></ol><p>I spent night after night adding Sylvaneth, Gloomspite Gitz, and Idoneth Deepkin, and I started to think… this is going to be nearly impossible to pull off alone. I started changing the tone of my forum posts, soliciting help and reminding people that they could add their army with only a basic level of dev experience.</p><p>My first contributor added a patch to the codebase 12 days after I released it on Reddit. I was thrilled - no one had ever contributed to any of my side projects before. I quickly wrote up a better README, created a sample army for contributors to base their armies on, and added a contribution guide. I created a Discord channel after someone asked me where they could chat with me.</p><p>Before long, I had quite a few contributors, an active Discord, and thriving Github activity. It seemed like every morning I woke up to a couple PR’s and tons of new issues. I was trying to keep ahead of the curve - I added pre-commit tooling to the codebase, tests, and helper utilities to check code quality. I was also making sure to properly type <em>everything</em> using Typescript - this helped ensure that contributors were entering data in the correct format.</p><p>After a while, I was able to almost entirely give away the task of data entry - people were submitting code for their favorite armies, spells, and abilities constantly. I began to get a little overwhelmed with requests for features - all of them good, but I was the only person really working on the React side of things.</p><p>As of today, I am really proud of the fact that we have <em>fourteen</em> contributors to the project, some of which have contributed thousands of lines of data and code. I am enormously grateful to each and every one of them.</p><p>We’ve currently closed 143 pull requests and 119 issues. We have 7 issues currently open. If you’re feeling adventurous, why not <a href=https://github.com/daviseford/aos-reminders>check out our Github?</a> We’d love to have you.</p><h3 id=the-evolution-of-the-tech-stack>The evolution of the tech stack</h3><p>This project started as a simple <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/">Create React App</a> build (with Typescript, of course).</p><p>At this point, we’re using these libraries (and more) to accomplish our goals.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a><ul><li>Invaluable to any project, but especially great for a data-heavy app.</li></ul></li><li><a href=https://github.com/immerjs/immer>Immer</a><ul><li>Used for updating state and performing immutable data operations.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://redux-starter-kit.js.org/">Redux Starter Kit</a><ul><li>Takes away a <em>lot</em> of the pain of setting up a Redux store.</li></ul></li><li><a href=https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select><code class=highlighter-rouge>react-select</code></a><ul><li>Gives us those beautiful multi-select, searchable, clearable dropdowns.</li></ul></li><li><a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky><code class=highlighter-rouge>husky</code></a>, <a href="https://prettier.io/"><code class=highlighter-rouge>prettier</code></a>, and <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/pretty-quick><code class=highlighter-rouge>pretty-quick</code></a><ul><li>Handles pre-commit chores for us, ensures code quality is consistent.</li></ul></li><li>Continuous Integration via <a href="https://codeship.com/">Codeship</a><ul><li>Builds and deploys our <code class=highlighter-rouge>master</code> branch to production automatically.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The entire project is written with React Hooks and functional components.

I really fell in love with <code class=highlighter-rouge>useMemo</code> when writing utilities to fetch army metadata - the average army has anywhere from 3,000 - 5,000 lines of rules associated with it. Quickly parsing those rules and delivering them to the user became a fun challenge for my coding skills.</p><p><em>P.S. Speaking of React, I’ll be going to <a href="https://conf.reactjs.org/">React Conf 2019</a>! <a href=https://alexander.pereyra.info/blog/2018/10/28/react-conf-2018-hooks.html>Last year was a blast</a> - send me an email if you’ll be there. Let’s meet up and talk about Hooks :)</em></p><p>Deployment of this project was initially handled by me running a basic bash script. The script ran <code class=highlighter-rouge>yarn build</code> and then uploaded the results to an S3 bucket. As the number of contributors and PR’s grew, an automated solution became more and more necessary. Enter <strong>Codeship</strong>! They offer 100 free builds a month, a great UI, and easy integration with Github. I really enjoy using them.</p><p>When a PR is submitted, approved, and squashed and merged to <code class=highlighter-rouge>master</code>, Codeship automatically kicks off a build - it checks for the latest dependencies, runs <code class=highlighter-rouge>yarn build</code>, and if there are no errors, deploys the result to an S3 bucket. It’s fast, easy, and most of all, automated!</p><h3 id=success-of-the-project>Success of the project</h3><p>In the span of three months, the page has received 34,000 pageviews (the real number is higher - I’m sure a large portion of the gaming community blocks the Google Analytics script).</p><p>It’s been shared across <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ageofsigmar/comments/cn8no6/aos_reminders_tournamentready_reminders_with_20/">Reddit</a>, <a href=https://twitter.com/ChuckSigmar/status/1161171507214725121>Twitter</a>, Facebook, and a number of <a href="https://www.tga.community/blogs/entry/2000-introducing-aos-reminders/">smaller</a> <a href="http://www.lustria-online.com/threads/automated-cheat-sheet-never-forget-your-abilities-again.23102/">communities</a>. It supports a ton of armies, scenery, and special rules.</p><p>It has been a labor of love for me and my contributors, and I’ll list some of our features here:</p><h4 id=supported-armies>Supported Armies</h4><div class=row><div class=col-6><ul><li>Beastclaw Raiders</li><li>Beasts Of Chaos</li><li>Chaos</li><li>Daughters Of Khaine</li><li>Dispossessed</li><li>Death</li><li>Destruction</li><li>Everchosen</li><li>Flesh Eater Courts</li><li>Fyreslayers</li><li>Gloomspite Gitz</li><li>Gutbusters</li><li>Idoneth Deepkin</li><li>Ironjawz</li><li>Kharadron Overlords</li><li>Khorne</li></ul></div><div class=col-6><ul><li>Legions Of Azgorh</li><li>Legions Of Nagash</li><li>Lethisian Army</li><li>Mercenary Companies</li><li>Nighthaunt</li><li>Nurgle</li><li>Order</li><li>Seraphon</li><li>Skaven</li><li>Slaanesh</li><li>Slaves To Darkness</li><li>Stormcast Eternals</li><li>Sylvaneth</li><li>Tamurkhans Horde</li><li>Tzeentch</li></ul></div></div><h4 id=features>Features</h4><div class=row><div class=col-6><ul><li>Units</li><li>Battalions</li><li>Spells</li><li>Endless Spells</li><li>Command Traits</li><li>Command Abilities</li><li>Allegiance Abilities</li></ul></div><div class=col-6><ul><li>Realmscape Artifacts</li><li>Realmscape Spells</li><li>Realmscape Features</li><li>Grand Alliance Spells</li><li>Grand Alliance Artifacts</li><li>Triumphs</li><li>Allied Armies</li></ul></div></div><div class="row justify-content-center pt-1 pb-3"><div class="col-10 text-center"><figure><a href=/blog/public/img/warhammer/aos-reminders/aos-reminders-desktop.png target=_blank><img src=/blog/public/img/warhammer/aos-reminders/aos-reminders-desktop.png class=img-fluid></a><figcaption class="text-center pt-1"><small>The current desktop UI</small></figcaption></figure></div></div><h4 id=if-you-havent-used-aos-reminders-yet-go-try-it>If you haven’t used AoS Reminders yet, <a href="https://aosreminders.com/">go try it!</a></h4><h3 id=next-steps>Next Steps</h3><p>At this point, the bulk of the work is done. We’ve added all of the current Age of Sigmar armies, and even a few that aren’t officially supported.</p><p>We have a few UI things we’d like to change around. We’re going to add drag and drop capabilities.</p><p>One of my most frequent requests is for a native iOS/Android application. I may tackle this down the line, once all of the current issues are resolved.</p><p>I could foresee this expanding to Warhammer 40k - however, as someone who’s never played a game of 40k, it is a daunting thought!</p><h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h3><p>When I started writing this codebase, I thought it would just be a fun little indulgence, like most of the code I write. I never thought I would have over a dozen contributors, tens of thousands of users, and fans all over the world. It has really been great!</p><p>Cheers, everyone!</p></div><hr></div><div class=col><nav aria-label=pagination><ul class="pagination pagination-lg justify-content-center"><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href="/blog/page/2/">Older</a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><small>&copy; 2019.
